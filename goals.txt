start with an empty board
you can add a board and move it around the screen and resize it to whatever you want
you can have multiple boards but they cant overlap


you have a tool bar on the left which you can use to create things such as:

add board which adds a whole board for you to create the below features on:
- checklists (that cross off when you click it)
- text box with heading and font options
- buttons where you can set up links to certain pages easily
- tables for storing relevant data
- archive to remove things off your board and save it off the board
- delete to remove these items

each one of these items snap to a grid for neat organisation

this will then need to be stored into a database for easy closing and reopening of the page
